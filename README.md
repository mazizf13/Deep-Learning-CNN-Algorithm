# Deep Learning - Based Classification of Dogs and Cats Images Using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) Algorithm

## Overview
This project aims to develop a deep learning-based classification model for distinguishing between images of dogs and cats. The model utilizes Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture, a popular choice for image processing tasks.

## Background
In the digital age, the ability to automatically classify images has become increasingly important. Image classification is the process of categorizing images into predefined classes or labels. This project focuses on the classification of images into two categories: dogs and cats.

## Methodology
The methodology employed in this project revolves around the use of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). CNN are a class of deep neural networks, most commonly applied to analyzing visual imagery. They have proven to be highly effective in tasks such as image recognition and classification.

## Objectives
The primary objective of this project is to develop a robust and accurate model for classifying images of dogs and cats. By achieving high accuracy in image classification, the model can be applied to various applications, including pet monitoring systems, animal welfare, and veterinary diagnostics.

## Dependencies
- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow
- Keras
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Google Colab (optional, for running notebooks)
